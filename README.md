This library is intended for my personal use for competitive programming. 
It implements several functions that can be useful for algorithmic operations. 
It is free for any private use without any permission, however some scripts have not been properly unit-tested. 
Furthermore, since this is intended for personal uses of competitive programming, error handling, such as but not limited to types and value errors are not done. 
By using this library, you must agree that the writer of this library does not take any respobsibilities for any damages, loss or any other consequences caused by the use of it. 
That being said, any suggestions and reports for bugs or any other issues are more than welcome.
